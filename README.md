# Loan Approval Prediction 🏦

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details using Machine Learning.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Banks receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manually evaluating them is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project automates loan approval prediction using historical data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains applicant information such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Property Area

## ⚙️ Approach
- Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Encoding (Label Encoding)
- Feature Scaling
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation

## 🧠 Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## 📈 Results
- Achieved approximately **79% accuracy** on test data
- Credit History was the most influential feature

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
